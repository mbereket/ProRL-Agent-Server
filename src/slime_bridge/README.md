# Slime Bridge

`slime_bridge` connects [Slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime)'s RL training
loop to a running Polar rollout server over HTTP. It lives **outside** the
`polar` package because Slime, Ray, Megatron, and torch are installed separately
— Polar depends on none of them.

## How it fits

Slime calls one entry point, `generate_rollout_polar_async`, wired in via
`--rollout-function-path`. From there the bridge:

- submits async task batches to `polar_rollout_url` (or a node derived from
  `polar_topology_path`) and collects each result through a local callback
  listener with a polling safety net;
- tracks rollout ids and policy versions, stamps Polar scheduler metadata
  (`group_id`, `policy_version`, `rollout_step`) onto every task, and keeps
  async admission bounded to the current Slime rollout request;
- converts each Polar `Trajectory` back into Slime `Sample`s (one per trace,
  grouped with Slime 0.3.0 `group_id` so all traces from a trajectory count
  once), dropping empty or oversized traces;
- computes dynamic-trace leave-one-trajectory-out advantages and zeroes out
  failed/aborted trajectories.

## Main files

- `config.py`: `PolarSlimeConfig` + `resolve_polar_slime_config`; also renders the
  task payload, the instruction, and the topology that points gateways at Slime's
  SGLang router.
- `rollout.py`: the async worker (submit → callback/poll → convert), the
  evaluation path, the acceptance filters, and the Slime entry point.
- `_messages.py`: prompt/message flattening shared by rollout + adapter.
- `adapter.py`: convert a Polar `SessionResult` into Slime `Sample`s.
- `data_source.py`: `CeilEpochRolloutDataSourceWithBuffer` — rounds the epoch
  length up so the dataset tail isn't skipped.
- `reward.py`: reward hook that reads the reward Polar already embedded.
- `reward_post_process.py`: trajectory-aware, group-normalized reward shaping.

## Training-signal knobs (Slime `--custom-config-path` YAML)

All default to the plain behavior; each is a one-line A/B.

| key | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `polar_timeout_reward_zero` | `false` | Agent `TIMEOUT` with captured traces trains as `COMPLETED` at reward 0 instead of being masked and excluded from the sibling baseline. `ERROR` stays masked. |
| `polar_group_id_scope` | `trajectory` | Slime's loss-aggregation unit. `trajectory`: every trajectory weighs the same. `prompt`: token-mean within the prompt's `n_samples_per_prompt` trajectories, then mean over prompts (SkyRL `prompt_mean`). |
| `polar_drop_zero_variance_groups` | `false` | Drop a group whose trainable trajectories all have the same reward (within `polar_zero_variance_tol`, 1e-6) or has fewer than two; a replacement prompt is pulled. Counted in `polar/dropped_zero_variance_groups`. |
| `polar_min_complete_accept_fraction` | `0` | Drop a group with fewer than this fraction of completed, trainable sessions. |

GRPO std scaling (slime's `--disable-grpo-std-normalization` opt-out) uses the
std over *all* valid trajectories in the group; the mean baseline is
leave-one-trajectory-out. Pair the bridge with
`gateway.nodes[].inference.training_sampling: true` in the topology so the
sampled distribution is the trained one (temperature 1, top_p 1, top_k -1).

## What the bridge owns

- Turn Slime samples + prompts into Polar task requests and submit async batches.
- Track rollout ids / policy versions and bound async admission to the current
  Slime rollout request.
- Filter unusable groups (zero trainable tokens, too few completed samples,
  logprob errors) with per-category metrics.
- Convert Polar trajectories back into Slime samples; compute dynamic-trace
  advantages.
- Run the evaluation path over `eval_datasets` and emit W&B metrics.

## Slime installation

Install Slime from the THUDM git checkout (not the unrelated PyPI `slime`
package). The SWE-Gym Slime GRPO example automates this with `launch_e2e.sh`; the
manual equivalent from the repository root is:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.3.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/THUDM/slime.git slime
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM.git Megatron-LM
bash scripts/patch/patch_slime_router_tokens.sh

uv pip install -e .
uv pip install -e slime
uv pip install -e Megatron-LM
```

Use `SLIME_DIR=/path/to/slime` and `MEGATRON_DIR=/path/to/Megatron-LM` for
checkouts outside the repository root. Run the patch command with the same
`SLIME_DIR` value before installing Slime. The patch preserves exact
SGLang-native prompt/output token ids and token-level logprobs in Slime's
OpenAI-compatible adapter response, so Polar does not retokenize trajectories
locally. The Slime training environment provides the heavy dependencies
(e.g. `torch`); Polar does not add them.
